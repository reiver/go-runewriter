# go-runewriter

Package **runewriter** provides the `RuneWriter` interface, for the Go programming language.

`RuneWriter` is an interface that _should_ exist in the Go built-in package `"io"` (as `io.RuneWriter`) but doesn't.

All of these built-in types are RuneWriters: `bufio.Writer`, `bytes.Buffer`, and `strings.Builder`.
